This repository contains a django web app integrated with a random forest model.
If the model doen't run on the machine, try to create a new one with the code in py-randomforest-sample repository

The server folder and gunicorn_config.py contain all the configurations in order to mount a server by using docker, 
but if you want to run the code just in local, you have to use this command: "python manage.py runserver".
